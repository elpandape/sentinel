All notable changes to `elpandape/sentinel` are documented here.

## v0.1.0 — Skeleton (2026-08-25)

### Added

- Package skeleton with the full quality toolchain: Pint, PHPStan (Larastan) at level `max`,
  Rector, and Pest 5 with coverage and type coverage gates at 100%.
- Docker + Make development environment: no PHP or Composer needed on the host.
- GitHub Actions for tests (PHP 8.4/8.5, Laravel 13, MySQL 9 and PostgreSQL 16), quality gates,
  nightly mutation testing and changelog updates.
- `config/sentinel.php` with every section the package will use through 1.0, defaults safe and
  future features off — publishing the config once is enough for the whole 0.x cycle.
- `Support\Config`: typed configuration reader that fails loudly on a wrong type or an unknown value.
- `Context\ExecutionContext`: request-scoped execution context with nestable, self-restoring scopes.
- `Sentinel` manager and facade: recording state, `pause()`, `resume()`, `withoutAuditing()`
  and `withContext()`.
- Enums `AuditEvent`, `Severity`, `Source` and `Mode`.
- English and Spanish translation namespaces wired and publishable.
